In one small village in Spain a boy was born. He was named Ricardo
and his passion was soccer. He played every day with his friends
and got better and better. His dream was to eventually play for a leading
European club but first he had to pass try outs in his local club called
Cartagena.

Richard: On the try-out day, he woke up very early in the morning, 
took a shower and had an energy bar before he did some warm ups.
 He felt very nervous because it was a precious chance for him
 to make a leap in his life and build up his future career.
