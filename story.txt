In one small village in Spain a boy was born. He was named Ricardo
and his passion was soccer. He played every day with his friends
and got better and better. His dream was to eventually play for a leading
European club but first he had to pass try outs in his local club called
Cartagena.

Richard: On the try-out day, he woke up very early in the morning, 
took a shower and had an energy bar before he did some warm ups.
 He felt very nervous because it was a precious chance for him
 to make a leap in his life and build up his future career.

It is known that the Cartagena tryouts are quite challenging but he knows,
if he makes it he could one day play for Barcelona. As Ricardo finishes warming up,
he realizes he is able to keep up with the pace. While in the zone, Ricardo recieves 
the ball; he goes for the run, dribbles past the defender, then shoots it top right 
corner. Its a goal!

Yeah~! The goal made the stadium filled with excitement. The gam ended with 1-0.
After the game he received many contact from company to work with them. So, he d
id and he made lot of money became rich. But, all of a sudden, he fell down fromthe bed and realized it was all dream!

That was a notable day in Ricardo's life. Only two years later he managed 
to join the Barcelona FC and had a stellar career at the club.
